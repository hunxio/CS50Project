In order to test and run it you will need to have Python and Flask installed on your device.
There are already setted up two different virtual enviroments, for Windows and MacOS,
you will only need to activate one of them and run flask:

```bash
$ username CS50Project % flask run
 * Debug mode: off

 * Running on http://123.4.5.6:7890
```
(The numbers after the http will be different)
