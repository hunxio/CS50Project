REMINDER F0R ME

In order to test the website and make it run, we need to install flask and
activate the virtual enviroment. Note that the virtutal enviroment it will
be already setted up, it just needs to be activated everytime; also the 
website cannot be hosted on github pages or others since it uses flask to
work. Here are a few steps to run it:

1.	virtualenvWindows\Scripts\activate
2.	pip install Flask
3.	setx FLASK_APP "hello.py"
