REMINDER F0R ME

EDIT: 
	The flask settings are already setted up on both MacOS and Windows,
	just need to run the flask commands to start it.
	
In order to test the website and make it run, we need to install flask and
activate the virtual enviroment. Note that the virtutal enviroment it will
be already setted up, it just needs to be activated everytime; also the 
website cannot be hosted on github pages or others since it uses flask to
work. Here are a few steps to run it:


Windows

0.	Open the terminal and go onto the dir.
1.	setx FLASK_APP "app.py"
2a.	flask run
		or
2b.	flask --app app.py --debug run (live edit)


MacOS

0.	Open the terminal and go onto the dir.
1.	. virtualenvOS/bin/activate
2.	pip install Flask
3.	export FLASK_APP=app.py
4a.	flask run
		or
4b.	flask --app app.py --debug run (live edit)

SQLITE3:

To visualize the table as an excel table:
1. Run sqlite3;
2. Use the command ".mode table";


HASHING AND VERIFYING PASSWORDS:

import argon2

# Define the password to be hashed
password = b'password1234#$'

# Hash the password using Argon2
hasher = argon2.PasswordHasher()
hashed_password = hasher.hash(password)

# Print the hashed password
print(hashed_password)

# Verify a password against a hashed password
# Note that this will return True if the password matches the hash
# and False if it does not.
new_password = b'password1234#$'
try:
    hasher.verify(hashed_password, new_password)
    print("Password is valid.")
except argon2.exceptions.VerifyMismatchError:
    print("Password is incorrect.")
