REMINDER F0R ME

EDIT: 
	The flask settings are already setted up on both MacOS and Windows,
	just need to run the flask commands to start it.
	
In order to test the website and make it run, we need to install flask and
activate the virtual enviroment. Note that the virtutal enviroment it will
be already setted up, it just needs to be activated everytime; also the 
website cannot be hosted on github pages or others since it uses flask to
work. Here are a few steps to run it:


Windows

1.	setx FLASK_APP "app.py"
2a.	flask run
		or
2b.	flask --app app.py --debug run (live edit)


MacOS

0.	Open the terminal and go onto the dir.
1.	. virtualenvOS/bin/activate
2.	pip install Flask
3.	export FLASK_APP=app.py
4a.	flask run
		or
4b.	flask --app app.py --debug run (live edit)
